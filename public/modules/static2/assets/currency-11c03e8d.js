  <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that operates independently of
    any tangible backing, utilizing cryptography for its creation, distribution,
    and maintenance, examples include Bitcoin, Litecoin, and BitShares. It
    leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, allowing everyone to issue it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency also serves as an online payment system facilitating
    anonymous transactions. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, is legally
    recognized in many countries.

  <h2>Why use cryptocurrency?</h2>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency is highly favored for several reasons: unlike traditional
    bank transfers, cryptocurrency transactions do not require long waiting
    times, are unaffected by the transaction amount or user location, and incur
    significantly lower fees—often just a few cents. Additionally,
    cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible and secure; they cannot be
    manipulated by banks, government agencies, or individuals, offering an
    anonymous alternative to conventional currency without the risk of
    confiscation.

  <h2>How do cryptocurrency transactions work?</h2>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency transactions are straightforward. Essentially, they involve
    sending cryptocurrency from one online wallet to another. The process starts
    when the payer sends a private key—a randomly generated number sequence—to
    the payee, initiating a transaction that undergoes between zero and five
    validations. While a standard transaction typically requires one validation,
    larger transactions may necessitate multiple validations. Each validation on
    the blockchain network takes about 10 minutes. Once validated, the
    transaction is visible on the blockchain, though sensitive details remain
    hidden.

  <h2>How to purchase cryptocurrency?</h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies can be bought in several ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Market exchange: Ideal for those unconcerned with privacy, as online
      market exchanges often require identification. Here, buyers can purchase
      and store their cryptocurrencies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Over-the-counter (OTC): This method involves face-to-face transactions,
      typically anonymous, between two parties. Despite the reduced anonymity of
      face-to-face interactions, this method remains popular. Buyers and sellers
      can connect via numerous websites.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cryptocurrency ATM: Similar to conventional ATMs, except that instead of
      cash, users receive a receipt with a code. Scanning this code transfers
      the cryptocurrency to the buyer’s wallet.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Is cryptocurrency legal?</h2>
  <p>
    The legal status of cryptocurrency is improving. Recently, Japan recognized
    Bitcoin as a legal currency, and Russia plans to acknowledge it as a
    financial tool, a significant shift since Bitcoin was previously banned
    there.
  </p>
  <p>
    As cryptocurrency gains global importance, regulatory, usage, and taxation
    policies continue to evolve. New laws are frequently enacted. For detailed
    information on your government's stance on cryptocurrency and potential
    future changes, consult a legal expert.

  <h2>Bitcoin wallets</h2>
  <p>There are various types of Bitcoin wallets available:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cloud-based wallets: These are the most convenient but require trusting
        the service provider with your cryptocurrency.
      </p>

  <h2>Protect your wallet</h2>
  <p>
    Proper usage ensures Bitcoin's security. Remember, safeguarding your funds
    is your responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>Consider the following security measures:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not store all your funds in one wallet.</li>
    <li>
      Choose your online wallet carefully; using two-factor authentication (2FA)
      adds an extra layer of security.
    </li>
    <li>
      Regularly back up your wallet, ideally encrypting Internet-exposed
      backups.
    </li>
    <li>
      Store your password securely, either memorized or in a physical, secure
      location.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a strong password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, at
      least 16 characters long.
    </li>
    <li>
      An offline wallet, or cold storage, offers the highest security by storing
      your wallet in a secure offline location, effectively protecting against
      online threats.
    </li>
  </ul>
