  <h2>LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES & GUIDELINES</h2>
  <p>GUIDELINES APPLICABLE FOR GOVERNMENT & LAW ENFORCEMENT</p>
  <p>
    These guidelines are provided for use by government and law enforcement agencies when seeking information from BC.GAME® about our players. __BC_HOST__® will update these Guidelines as necessary.
  </p>
  <p>All other requests for information regarding __BC_HOST__® customers, including customer questions about information disclosure, should be directed to legal@bcgame.com.</p>
  <p>For government and law enforcement information requests, __BC_HOST__® complies with the laws pertaining to global entities that control our data and we provide details as legally required. For all requests from government and law enforcement agencies, with the exception of emergency circumstances, __BC_HOST__® will only provide content in response to a search warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause, customer consent, or must comply with applicable laws, __BC_HOST__® has a centralized process for receiving, tracking, processing, and responding to legitimate legal requests from government and law enforcement from when they are received until when a response is provided. A trained team in our legal department reviews and evaluates all requests received, and requests which __BC_HOST__® determines to have no valid legal basis or considers to be unclear, inappropriate or over-broad are objected, challenged, rejected or in most cases, ignored.</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__® will only provide responses to the requesting law enforcement agency at the official law enforcement email address of the requesting officer only. There are no exceptions to this rule. All evidence preservation pursuant to the responses provided by __BC_HOST__® is the responsibility of the requesting law enforcement agency.</p>
  <p>Subpoenas, search warrants, and court orders that law enforcement submits to __BC_HOST__® should seek information regarding a particular __BC_HOST__® player or wallet address. __BC_HOST__® can provide information in so far as __BC_HOST__® still possesses the requested information pursuant to its data retention policies.</p>
  <p>All data is retained for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in our privacy policy. Government and law enforcement agencies should be as narrow and specific as possible when fashioning their legal process to avoid misinterpretation, objection, challenge, rejection or being ignored in response to an unclear, inappropriate, or over-broad request.</p>
  <p>A search warrant issued upon a probable cause showing is required when government and law enforcement are requesting customer content. Nothing within these Guidelines is meant to create any enforceable rights against __BC_HOST__®, and __BC_HOST__® policies may be updated or changed in the future without further notice to government or law enforcement.</p>

  <h2>SERVICE OF LEGAL PROCESS</h2>
  <p>Government, Law Enforcement, and Private Party Subpoenas, Search Warrants, and Court Orders</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__® accepts service of legal process by email to legal@bcgame.com from government and law enforcement agencies, provided it is transmitted from the official email address of the requesting agency. To help ensure the legal process __BC_HOST__® receives is in the form and substance the issuing authority authorized, __BC_HOST__® requires submission of the complete legal process, including attachments, in an uneditable PDF.</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__® will not download legal process documents through any links provided in an email due to system security standards. Additionally, providing a link to download the legal process will not be considered valid service of process. For data security purposes, the complete legal process should be transmitted in password-protected documents and the password transmitted in a separate email.</p>
  <p>When government or law enforcement serve legal process on __BC_HOST__® by email to legal@bcgame.com, there is no need to serve a paper copy by mail. </p>
  <p>Managing and Responding to Government, Law Enforcement, and Private Party Subpoenas, Search Warrants, and Court Orders</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__® carefully reviews all legal requests to ensure that there’s a valid legal basis for each request, and complies with legally valid requests. Where __BC_HOST__® determines that there is no valid legal basis or where a request is considered to be unclear, inappropriate or over-broad, __BC_HOST__® will object, challenge, reject or ignore the request.</p>
  <p>Witness Testimony Subpoenas</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__® will not waive service requirements for subpoenas seeking witness testimony nor accept service via electronic means. All subpoenas seeking witness testimony must either be personally served on __BC_HOST__® or served through __BC_HOST__® registered agent for service of process. __BC_HOST__® will resist subpoenas for witness testimony that are served with fewer than 14 days advance notice.</p>
  <p>Preservation Requests</p>
  <p>Requests to preserve information should be transmitted directly from an official government or law enforcement email address to legal@bcgame.com. Preservation requests must include the relevant __BC_HOST__® ID/account email address, or full name and physical address of the customer of the subject __BC_HOST__® account.</p>
  <p>When a preservation request has been received, __BC_HOST__® will preserve a one-time data pull of the requested existing customer data available at the time of the request for 90 days. After this 90 day period, the preservation will be automatically removed from the storage server. However, this period can be extended for one additional 90-day period upon receipt of a renewed request.</p>
  <p>An attempt to serve more than two preservation requests for the same account will result in the second request being treated as a request for an extension of the original preservation, and not a separate preservation of new data. Requests for initiations of new preservations of data should be separately submitted, and must not be combined with requests for extensions of existing preservations.</p>
  <p>Emergency Requests</p>
  <p>Authorized disclosure of data, including customer content, by __BC_HOST__® may be made under certain circumstances as an exception to the requirement that government or law enforcement obtain a search warrant for customer content.</p>
  <p>in situations in which the case involves an emergency, __BC_HOST__® is permitted, but not required, to voluntarily disclose information, including contents of communications and customer records where __BC_HOST__® believes in good faith that an emergency involving imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires such disclosure without delay.</p>
  <p>In order to request that __BC_HOST__® voluntarily disclose information on an emergency basis, the requesting government or law enforcement officer should include in the title/subject line: “Emergency Government & Law Enforcement Information Request” and transmit it directly from their official government or law enforcement email address to legal@bcgame.com.</p>
  <p>If a government or law enforcement agency seeks customer data in response to an Emergency Government & Law Enforcement Information Request, a supervisor for the government or law enforcement agent who submitted the Emergency Government & Law Enforcement Information Request may be contacted and asked to confirm to __BC_HOST__® that the emergency request was legitimate.</p>
  <p>The government or law enforcement agent who submits the Emergency Government & Law Enforcement Information Request should provide the supervisor's contact information in the request.</p>
  <p>Account Restriction/Deletion Requests</p>
  <p>If a government or law enforcement agency requests that __BC_HOST__® restrict/delete a customer’s __BC_HOST__® ID, __BC_HOST__® requires a court order (often a judgment of conviction or warrant) demonstrating the account to be restricted/deleted was used unlawfully.</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__® carefully reviews all requests from government and law enforcement to ensure there’s a valid legal basis for each request. In instances where __BC_HOST__® determines there is no valid legal basis or where the court order does not demonstrate that the account to be restricted/deleted was used unlawfully, __BC_HOST__® will reject/challenge/ignore the request.</p>
  <p>Where __BC_HOST__® receives a satisfactory court order (often a judgment of conviction or warrant) from government or law enforcement demonstrating that the account to be restricted/deleted was used unlawfully, __BC_HOST__® will take the requisite action to restrict/delete the account in compliance with the court order; and advise the requesting agent/party accordingly.</p>
  <p>Customer Notice</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__® will notify customers when their __BC_HOST__® account information is being sought in response to legal process from government or law enforcement, except where providing notice is explicitly prohibited by the legal process itself, by a court order __BC_HOST__® receives, by applicable law or where __BC_HOST__®, in its sole discretion, believes that providing notice creates a risk of injury or death to an identifiable individual.</p>
  <p>After 90 days, __BC_HOST__® will provide delayed notice for emergency disclosures except where notice is prohibited by court order or applicable law or where __BC_HOST__®, in its sole discretion, believes that providing notice could create a risk of injury or death to an identifiable individual.</p>
  <p>__BC_HOST__® will provide delayed notice after expiration of the non-disclosure period specified in a court order unless __BC_HOST__®, in its sole discretion, reasonably believes that providing notice could create a risk of injury or death to an identifiable individual or group of individuals or where notice is not applicable to the underlying facts of the case.</p>
