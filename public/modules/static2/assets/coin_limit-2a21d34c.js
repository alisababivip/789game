  <h2>Fiat Currency Display for Cryptocurrency Players</h2>
  <p>
    Those who choose to view their cryptocurrency balances as fiat currency
    equivalents ("Converted Balances") must understand that these are merely
    approximate estimates for reference only. Despite BC Game's diligent efforts
    to use accurate and current conversion rates, all transactions, wagers, and
    settlements on our platform are made and settled in cryptocurrency.

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    __BC_HOST__ explicitly disclaims any responsibility for inaccuracies, errors, or
    discrepancies in the Converted Balances. Players should consider the
    cryptocurrency amount as the primary value for all transactions and wagers,
    and they should understand that any reliance on the fiat conversion
    estimates, or "Converted Balances," is entirely at their own risk.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Third-Party Games</h2>
  <p>
    Our platform integrates third-party games that offer fiat conversion display
    options ("Third-Party Converted Balances"). __BC_HOST__ is not responsible for
    any differences between the Converted Balances displayed on our site and
    those shown in third-party games.

  <h2>Reporting Discrepancies</h2>
  <p>
    We urge players to report any differences or irregularities between the
    displayed Converted Balances and the actual cryptocurrency amounts
    immediately. Reports should be made to our support team for prompt review
    and resolution. Timely reporting helps us continuously improve the accuracy
    of information and the player experience.

  <h2>Coin Accuracy Limit</h2>
  <p>
    Due to data storage accuracy limitations, changes below a specified amount
    will not be recorded. The minimum accuracy of most coins aligns with the
    blockchain's currency precision. For example, the smallest unit for SATS is
    1. The minimum data storage precision for each coin is detailed in the table
    below:
