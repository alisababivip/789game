  <h2>How do I create a Passkey?</h2>
  <p>
    Creating a Passkey allows you to log in to your __BC_HOST__ account quickly and
    securely, without needing to enter a password. Follow the steps below to set
    up Passkey on a compatible device.
  </p>
  <p>Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Passkey</p>
  <p>1. Log in to Your __BC_HOST__ Account</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Start by logging in to your __BC_HOST__ account using your usual method (such
      as email, password, or 2FA).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>2. Go to Account Security Settings</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Once logged in, navigate to the Account Settings page, then select
      Security Settings.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>3. Select “Enable Passkey”</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In the Security Settings, look for the Passkey option and click Enable
      Passkey.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may see a brief explanation of Passkey’s benefits, such as quick,
      password-free login and enhanced security.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>4. Verify Your Identity</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To ensure account security, __BC_HOST__ will ask you to verify your identity.
      This may require entering your account password or completing a 2FA check
      (such as a code sent via SMS or email).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>5. Set Up Passkey with Device’s Biometric Authentication</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      After identity verification, __BC_HOST__ will prompt your device to start the
      Passkey setup process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Follow the on-screen instructions on your device to authorize Passkey
      using your preferred authentication method:
    </li>
    <li>
      Fingerprint: Place your finger on your device’s fingerprint scanner.
    </li>
    <li>Face Recognition: Use your device’s face recognition feature.</li>
    <li>
      Device PIN: For devices that do not support biometric authentication, use
      your device PIN as an alternative.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>6. Passkey Created Confirmation</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Once you’ve completed the biometric or PIN setup, __BC_HOST__ will confirm
      that your Passkey is successfully created.
    </li>
    <li>
      You’ll now see this device listed in your Passkey-enabled devices under
      Security Settings.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>7. Using Passkey for Future Logins</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The next time you log in to __BC_HOST__ on this device, simply select Log in
      with Passkey. You’ll be prompted to confirm with your fingerprint, face
      recognition, or PIN instead of entering your password.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Important Notes</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Device Compatibility: Passkey requires a device that supports biometric
      authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) or device PIN. Check your
      device settings if you're unsure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multiple Devices: You can create a Passkey on multiple devices. Follow the
      same steps above to set up a Passkey on each additional device.
    </li>
    <li>
      Removing a Passkey: If you want to remove Passkey from a device, go to
      your Security Settings, find the Passkey-enabled device list, and select
      “Remove” next to the device name.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Creating a Passkey provides an easy, secure way to log in to __BC_HOST__. If you
    have any questions or run into issues, feel free to contact our support team
    for assistance.

  <h2>How Do I Sign In with a Passkey Instead of a Password?</h2>
  <p>
    Signing in with a Passkey allows you to access your __BC_HOST__ account quickly
    and securely without needing to enter a password. Here’s how to log in using
    Passkey on a supported device.
  </p>
  <p>Step-by-Step Guide to Sign In with a Passkey</p>
  <p>1. Open the __BC_HOST__ Login Page</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On your device, go to the __BC_HOST__ login page as you normally would.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>2. Select “Sign in with Passkey”</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instead of entering your email and password, look for the “Sign in with
      Passkey” option on the login page and select it.
    </li>
    <li>
      This option will only appear if you’ve already set up Passkey on the
      current device. (If you haven’t set up Passkey yet, refer to the “How to
      Create a Passkey” FAQ for guidance.)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>3. Confirm with Biometric Authentication or PIN</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your device will now prompt you to authenticate using your chosen method:
    </li>
    <li>Fingerprint: Place your finger on your device’s fingerprint sensor.</li>
    <li>Face Recognition: Use your device’s camera to scan your face.</li>
    <li>
      Device PIN: If biometric authentication isn’t available, you can use your
      device’s PIN code.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>4. Access Your Account</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Once authentication is successful, you’ll be instantly signed in to your
      __BC_HOST__ account, no password needed!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additional Information</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Multiple Devices: You can set up and use Passkey on multiple devices.
      Follow the steps in the How to Create a Passkey FAQ to enable it on other
      devices you want to use.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fallback Option: If Passkey is not set up or not available on a device,
      you can still sign in using your regular password and any additional
      security features like 2FA.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enhanced Security: Signing in with Passkey offers added security since
      it’s tied to your device’s biometric authentication, reducing the risk of
      unauthorized access.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Using Passkey makes it faster and safer to log in to your __BC_HOST__ account.
